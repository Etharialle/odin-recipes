    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Dough</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Flour - 3 cups</li>
        <li>Cream of tartar - 2 teaspoons</li>
        <li>Baking soda - 1 teaspoon</li>
        <li>Cinnamon - 1 1/2 teaspoon</li>
        <li>Salt 1/2 teaspoon</li>
        <li>Butter - 1 cup</li>
        <li>Sugar - 1 1/3 cup</li>
        <li>Egg - 1 large + 1 yolk</li>
        <li>Vanilla extract - 2 teaspoons</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Topping</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Sugar - 1/3 cup</li>
        <li>Cinnamon - 1 teaspoon</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F</li>
        <li>Line cookie sheets with parchment paper</li>
        <li>Make the topping by combining the sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl</li>
        <li>Whisk the flour, cream of tartar, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt together in a medium bowl.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl using a hand mixer or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter and granulated sugar together on high speed until smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the egg, egg yolk, and vanilla extract. Beat on medium-high speed until combined. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed. With the mixer running on low speed, slowly add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients in 3 different parts. The dough will be thick.</li>
        <li>Roll cookie dough into balls, about 1.5 Tablespoons of cookie dough each. I recommend this cookie scoop. Roll the dough balls in cinnamon-sugar topping. Sprinkle extra cinnamon-sugar on top if desired. Arrange 3 inches apart on the baking sheets.</li>
        <li>Bake cookies for 10 minutes. The cookies will be very puffy and soft. When they are still very warm, lightly press down on them with the back of a spoon or fork to help flatten them out. Allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 10 minutes and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>
